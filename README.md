# Readme not ready yet
## Note: to run the project almost 100% locally, you need node installed and the following steps:

## To run the project
```https://github.com/giovannirizzello/WorldTracker.git```

```cd WorldTracker```

```git clone https://github.com/giovannirizzello/ws4kp-international.git```

Then:
```./setup.sh```

```python3 -m pip install Flask```

and finally 
```python3 main.py```

## Now open ```http://127.0.0.1:8085```

Note: a web app that's NOT mine (the Node app) will be running in the background until you close the python code. You can access it at 127.0.0.1:8080
